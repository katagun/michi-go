Michi-Go --- Michi recoded in Go
================================

This is a recoding in Go (for speed) of the michi.py code by Petr Baudis avalaible at 
https://github.com/pasky/michi.

Michi stands for "Minimalistic Pachi". This is a Minimalistic Go MCTS Engine. The aims of the project are best explained by the author: 

> Michi aims to be a minimalistic but full-fledged Computer Go program based
> on state-of-art methods (Monte Carlo Tree Search) and written in Python.
> Our goal is to make it easier for new people to enter the domain of
> Computer Go, peek under the hood of a "real" playing engine and be able
> to learn by hassle-free experiments - with the algorithms, add heuristics,
> etc.

> This is not meant to be a competitive engine; simplicity and clear code is
> preferred over optimization (after all, it's in Python!).  But compared to
> other minimalistic engines, this one should be able to beat beginner
> intermediate human players, and I believe that a *fast* implementation
> of exactly the same heuristics would be around 4k KGS or even better.
